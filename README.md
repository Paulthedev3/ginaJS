# ginaJS - a Discord ChapGPT-powered bot

I've deployed this in my channel, discord.gg/martinshkreli and everyone seems to like it.
For this to work, you need a Discord token, clientId and guildId. Put those in a file called config.json. You can rename sampleconfig.json that I provided.

You also need an OpenAI account. Create a .env file with two keys:

OPENAIORG=org-yourorgcode
OPENAIKEY=sk-yourapikey

## what to expect
Gina isn't perfect, but your users will enjoy it. Feel free to adjust the temperature and play around with other settings. Hopefully in a new update I'll add more features to Gina. Let me know what you want to see!
